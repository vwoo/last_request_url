LastRequestURL
===============

This Rails plugin will keep track of the last request URL. A common use case is to redirect the user back to where they were before attempting to login or logout.


Example
=======

To use this plugin, add the following into #{Rails.root}/app/controllers/application.rb:

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include VincentWoo::LastRequestUrl
  after_filter: :track_last_request_url
end



To access the last request url from the controller or view, call #last_request_url.



By default, a request is recorded only:
  1) through the GET method
  2) if the format not nil or is is HTML

The reason for the HTML requirement is that users are normally redirected to webpages. If the last request was for a PDF, for instance, the user will be asked to download it again.



If you have a different set of criteria, override #track_last_request_url? in the controller to return a boolean.



If you want to be selective of which controller should or should not track the request url, then do:
skip_before_filter track_last_request_url
